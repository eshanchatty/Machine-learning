Aim: Classification of imagenet data using Neural network models

Objectives:
  Download from imagenet (Atleast ->Train-60, val-20,test-20)
  Perform data  augmentation
  Decide the bayes optimal error for the dataset
  Perform classification on given dataset
  Perform error analysis
  Select correct architecture for maximum accuracy on cross validation and test set
  Plot accuracy vs validation acc and loss vs validation loss during epochs
  List hyper-parameters used and callbacks
  Layers, units, activations (settings of activations), initializers, regularizers
  Batchnorm, dropout rate
  Optimizer settings - learning rate, momentum
  Metrics
  Loss function
  Train, validation and test split
  Callbacks settings - earlystopping, modelcheckpoint, reduceLR
  Data augmentations used
  Batch size, steps per epoch, epochs
