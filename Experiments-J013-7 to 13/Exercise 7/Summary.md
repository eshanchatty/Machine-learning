Aim: Classification using Neural network models

Objectives:
  Perform classification on given dataset
  Tackle Null values, Correct mismatched data types, plot correlation matrix as heatmap and preprocessing as needed
  Select correct architecture for maximum accuracy on cross validation and test set
  Plot accuracy vs validation acc and loss vs validation loss during epochs
  List hyper-parameters used and callbacks

    datasets.fetch_covtype()
    datasets.fetch_kddcup99()
    datasets.load_breast_cancer()
    datasets.load_wine()
